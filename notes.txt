adminusername and clusterid need to have a relation.
when inserting request ,instead of passing both of them we can do that by just clusterid as a cluster as its unique admin
do something bout it

instead of deleting request entry add it to accepted request / request history to show it in another tab on request status

login is not safe
one can just enter url with username and be done with it

add functionality to remove a user from cluster

update detailsitem.html to display map route 


update match function using api to show only those options which are practical


update recieved request to show:-
  google map with all locations added including the request
  how much extra kilometers are added to the ride

add functionality(a new table or in current schema) to store each users payment based on cost/km and price division based on some function
